# Ada complementary exercises

These exercices are intended for the braves learning algorithmics in Ada. Don't listen to the haters, Ada is pedagogic as hell, Onizuka-style (
you know, the brilliant mind creator of the pedagogic roundhouse kick).

They will cover the basics of algorithmics, instanciated in Ada :
- Data types
- Conditions
- Loops
- Procedure and Functions

# How does this work ?

Below is a demonstration coding exercise. The assignment is the following : The program should display the sentence "Hello World!", and terminate.

@[Hello world demonstrator]({"stubs": ["hello_world.adb"], "command": "sh start.sh", "project":"00_welcome"})

To run the example, press the big "Run" button (no shit Scherlock). The ada compiler displays its output in the standard error, and your program in the standard output.
